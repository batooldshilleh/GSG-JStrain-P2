# GSG-JStrain-P2

Create a NodeJS/JavaScript application that manages a to-do list.<br>
- The app should include features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks,<br>
 filtering the list by completed or incomplete tasks, and sorting tasks by the due date or priority.<br>
- To create the Task object with properties like task description, due date, and priority level, use prototypes.<br>
- Manage the list of tasks using arrays and array methods such as push(), filter(), and sort().<br>
- When a user adds a new task, create a new Task object and add it to the array.<br>
- When a user marks a task as completed, use filter() to find the task in the array and update its status.<br>
- When a user deletes a task, remove it from the array using splice().<br>
- You mean need to use something like (stdin) to read input from the user (Google it  )<br>
- Print for the user a list of actions that he can do.<br>

## Example:
***************************<br>
Welcome to JS TODO-APP<br>
***************************<br>
Select an action:<br>
1) Add a new task<br>
2) List all tasks<br>
3) List completed tasks<br>
4) Mark the task as done<br>
5) Delete a task<br>
6) Sort tasks by the due date<br>
7) Sort tasks by priority<br>
8) Clear all tasks<br>
***************************<br>
What's your choice?<br>
